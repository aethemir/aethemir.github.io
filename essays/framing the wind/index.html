    <h1>Framing the Wind</h1>
    <h2>Amir Rassouli</h2>

    <p>The empty walls of Laura’s new apartment stared back at her, as 
blank and daunting as the canvas before her. She stood in the center of 
the room, paintbrush in hand, frozen between the urge to recreate the 
familiar landscapes of home and the whisper of something new, something 
yet unexplored. In that moment of hesitation, caught between who she was 
and who she might become, Laura reflected the eternal human struggle: How 
do we change and grow while remaining true to ourselves?</p>

    <p>When it says ‘true’ it doesn’t imply factually true, but 
essentially true. In other means, when Laura was a child and wanted to see 
herself in the mirror, she didn’t expect to see her face in its current 
age. She was certain that she would see herself as her expected age. In 
fact, by getting older, her facial features have grown, but in essence, 
Laura has maintained the same anatomical face with fixed genes that 
expressed over time as expected, with a name that’s still Laura, and with 
a sense of familiarity that is relieving to her.</p>

    <p>This realization lit a new question in Laura’s mind: If her 
physical self could change so gradually yet profoundly without losing her 
let’s say identity, could the same be true for the intangible aspects of 
her being? Were her personality, and her very character as malleable as 
her facial features? and if so, how could she ensure that the core of who 
she was remained intact?</p>

    <p>A couple of months ago, in a search for a new perspective, Laura 
had a defining moment when she tried Marijuana for the first time. Her 
surroundings seemed to come alive. Colors appeared richer, textures more 
vivid, the motion of objects felt impossibly fluid, and sounds more 
resonant, as if every detail of the world had become amplified. All of 
this, she realized, was the substance mimicking her brain’s natural 
neurotransmitters. It triggered an intense burst of neural activity that 
overprocessed every sensation. What surprised her most, however, wasn’t 
just the vividness of the experience, but the profound familiarity of it 
all; a scene she had witnessed countless times before, now reframed and 
reborn with a little, almost imperceptible difference.</p>

    <p>But she decided to never try the substance again. Not because of 
its induced psychosis, but, paradoxically, because she wanted to have 
sadness among the experience, and she couldn’t. She wanted to feel her 
genuine feelings, but the artificial excitement wouldn’t allow it. She had 
rejected the shortcut. The easy, chemical reframing was not the answer. 
She had to face the authentic landscape of her own mind, even its most 
desolate regions.</p>

    <p>Grief was never as linear as people pretended it to be. It curled, 
struck, and surged without warning; never a steady climb through the 
Kübler-Ross stages toward healing. It was far less predictable. It had 
been two years since the breakup, the moment when her ex-partner told her 
he needed to leave, to permanently return to Iran, to care for his family. 
After years, they had to separate. Despite all the pain and misery, they’d 
kept those last months together beautiful in its fragility, and profoundly 
honest. They knew the end was certain but refused to let it turn ugly. 
Like a stage-four romance cancer; incurable, but dignified in its dying 
days. That incurable past was the familiar landscape now holding her 
hostage.</p>

    <p>Then, three months ago, Laura met someone interesting. At first, it 
felt like a casual distraction, but the more time she spent with him, the 
more she found herself drawn in. His facial features were almost like her 
ex-partner’s, yet with a maturity that softened the edges, both familiar 
and refined. The way he spoke, the quiet hesitations that gave his words 
weight, reminded her of what she used to love about her ex-partner, only 
with an ease that felt natural. His sense of humor was effortlessly 
amusing, something she always wanted to see in her ex-partner. It was 
almost as if he were an improved version of the past she hadn’t been ready 
to let go of: a familiar melody played in a slightly different key.</p>

    <p>You have repetition in music as a key element, but to prevent 
boredom, you need to bend it, twist it, and let it wander just far enough 
to surprise the ear before returning to the theme. Like a progressive 
track, he carried familiar motifs but stretched them into unexpected 
passages.</p>

    <p>This experience brought to her mind a growing trend on Twitter 
where Iranians share end-of-month random snapshots. A reflection of tired 
eyes in a car window at dusk, the soft imprint of a ring removed after 
hours of wear, a half-filled notebook with hurried thoughts. What makes 
them so aesthetic isn’t the subject itself but the perspective: the way 
light slants at an angle that turns the mundane into something unexpected. 
It transforms clutter into composition, coincidence into intention, and 
fleeting moments into something timeless.</p>

    <p>And in that connection, she found her clue. What fascinated Laura 
about this new person wasn’t just him, but the perspective he personified. 
He wasn’t a replacement for her past; he was a living demonstration of how 
a familiar theme could be reshaped into a new vision. Her grief, she now 
understood, was not just about the person she had lost, but about the 
meaning she had lost with him. The solution wasn’t to find that exact 
meaning again, but to create new meaning from the memory of it. The new 
man had been a key that unlocked a door within her and showed her how to 
look at her own history without drowning. Once that door was open, the key 
itself became less relevant.</p>

    <p>Laura walked back into the empty room. The blank canvas no longer 
seemed daunting; it glowed in the slanting afternoon light, an object of 
pure potential. She picked up her brush, felt its familiar weight, and 
then, with a hot tear traced a path down her cheek, she set it back down. 
It wasn’t just about a new way to paint, but a new way to see. Her art 
wasn’t about recreating a feeling on canvas, but about framing the world 
as it was.</p>

    <p>She picked up her camera, and angled it toward the blank canvas, 
catching the reflection of the window, the dramatic shadow of the easel, 
and the deep indigo of the twilight sky. The empty canvas, the symbol of 
her fear, was now the subject. She saw the unseen current of her own life, 
the clutter of her past and the emptiness of her future, all held together 
in a composition. She took the picture. It was a portrait of a fleeting 
moment transformed into something timeless; an invisible force given form. 
She was framing the wind.</p>
